# BM Pure Session Indicator

## Overview
The Pure Session Indicator Add-on is a lightweight JavaScript tool designed for the Pure time writing web interface. It enhances user experience by adding a small indicator in the menu bar at the top right of the interface. This indicator shows whether the current user session is active, providing real-time session status updates.

## Features
- **Session Status Indicator:** Displays a live session status in the menu bar, using emoticons to indicate an active (✅) or inactive (❌) session.
- **Automatic Refresh:** The session status is refreshed every 10 seconds.

## Installation
Users can install this add-on by injecting the JavaScript code into the Pure web interface. This injection can be performed using browser extensions that allow custom scripts to be added to web pages.

### For Firefox Users:
We recommend using the [Code Injector](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/codeinjector/) extension for Firefox. To install:

2. Navigate to the Pure web interface.
3. Open Code Injector and paste the JavaScript code provided below into the script field.
4. Ensure that the script is set to run on every page load.
